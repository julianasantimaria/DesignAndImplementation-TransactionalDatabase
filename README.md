# Project DataBase - Conclusion (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul - IFRS)

This project is an implementation of a Transactional database. The Database project is developed together with the development and implementation of an application (in this case a CRM was considered).

Interaction with Backend developers and business rules is essential throughout the entire stage for proper implementation of the Database.

## Overview

This project is focused on storing data in a database, where it collects data directly from the application in real time. We call it a transactional database, due to its purpose.

This project is focused:

- Alignment and development of the database with the banking structure;
- Storage of data in real time and consumption of the application in real time (Storage and visualization of data);
- Understanding business rules for better data storage;

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **`documents`**: Database implementation, architecture and analysis. All phases of database implementation - Conceptual, Logical and Physical.
2. **`tables`**: SQL construction of all tables - physical model.
3. **`index`**: SQL construction of all indices and constraints - physical model.

## Requisites

Make sure you have a code generator for creating the physical SQL model and a document reader and writer.
