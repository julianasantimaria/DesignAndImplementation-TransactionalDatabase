# Project IFRS- DataBase - Conclusion

This project is an implementation of a Transactional database. The Database project is developed together with the development and implementation of an application (in this case a CRM was considered).

Interaction with Backend developers and business rules is essential throughout the entire stage for proper implementation of the Database.

## Overview

- Understanding business rules for better data storage;
